# The GitHub Terms of Service
&dagger; Effective date: November 13, 2019

<BR>
<TABLE BORDER="1px"><TR><TD>

## Important Preliminaries

#### One-row, two-cell tables
&dagger; For each one-row, two-cell table in this document, whilst the condition detailed in the left cell of the table evaluates to true, the right cell of the table should be observed. In such cases, the right cell should be read straight after the left cell, to provide the correct context for the right-cell text. In all other cases, the right cell can be ignored. Such tables are meant to be read in this manner, and have no other significance.

#### About collapsible texts
<TABLE>
 <TR>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">&dagger; You don't know how to use collapsible texts</TD>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">

&dagger; The heading for any particular block of collapsible text is always displayed, whether the block be collapsed or expanded. You can toggle whether a block of collapsible text is expanded or collapsed, by clicking upon the block's heading.
   </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

#### ‘:collapsible:’ texts
&dagger; The text ':collapsible:' is only and always used as the heading for a block of collapsible text where the block isn't one of the summaries outlined in the “Section titles and summaries” subsection (that comes just after this subsection). The text within such blocks **are** legally binding to the extent that they are relevant. 

#### Section titles and summaries
&dagger; The different sections in this document have titles. They sometimes also have brief summaries, where each such summary is composed of a block of collapsible text having the text ':short:' as its heading.

<TABLE>
 <TR>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">&dagger; You want extra, inessential information about these summaries</TD>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">
     <details><summary open="false">:collapsible:</summary><BR>

&dagger; Each such summary appears just after the relevant section title, and immediately before the relevant section body. The collapsible block for such a summary is expanded when the text on the first line beneath the relevant ':short:' text, begins with the text 'Short version:'.
    </details>
   </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

&dagger; Such titles and summaries are not legally binding, and so can be completely ignored.

#### Daggered texts
&dagger; In order to understand the obligations directly imposed upon you in this document, you only need to read the texts marked with a dagger (single-character symbol at beginning of this paragraph).

<TABLE>
 <TR>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">&dagger; Such dagger use (which is in fact the only use of the dagger) is important in your processing / reading of this document</TD>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">
     <details><summary open="false">:collapsible:</summary><BR>

&dagger; Texts are marked with daggers in one of the following ways:
* when a paragraph (including a paragraph consisting of just one sentence) begins with a dagger;
* when a list forms the first text immediately after such a daggered paragraph;
* when a list forms the first text immediately after a line of text that consists of just a dagger.

&dagger; Please note that if the dagger symbol is not being rendered for you, this subsection may not be helpful for discovering all such obligations. Also note that whilst the text ':collapsible:' never begins with a dagger, in the absence of an indication that you don't need to examine a particular collapsible text, you do need to expand such a collapsible text to check whether there are any texts relevant to the rule outlined here within such collapsible blocks. 

<TABLE>
 <TR>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">&dagger; You want at least one example illustrating when the dagger has been used.</TD>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">
     <details><summary open="false">:collapsible:</summary><BR>

&dagger; Example of obligation directly imposed upon you in this document, and so where dagger has been used:

- A valid email address is required to complete the signup process (which is explicitly specified in document).
  
&dagger; Example of possible obligation that is not directly imposed upon you in this document, and hence where dagger has **not** been used:
- You believe you are obligated to backup some of your GitHub content because of GitHub’s liability limitation in the document. The document doesn’t specify that you need to do this, but you have inferred that such an obligation exists (in an indirect way).

For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service.

## C. Acceptable Use
<details><summary open="false"><b>:short:</b> </summary>

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

</details>

&dagger; Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws (including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction), and you are responsible for this compliance.

&dagger; You are not allowed, under any circumstances, to violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://help.github.com/articles/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-community-guidelines).

<BR>

## D. User-Generated Content
<details><summary open="false"><b>:short:</b> </summary>

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

</details>

#### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
&dagger; You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

#### 2. GitHub May Remove Content
We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.

#### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
&dagger; You:
1) retain ownership of, and responsibility for, Your Content, 
2) are only allowed to submit Content that you have the right to post,
3) are responsible for such submitted Content (even when you don't own the Content), AND
4) must fully comply with any third party licenses relating to such Content.

&dagger; Because of 1) above, you grant us — and other GitHub Users — the legal permissions listed in Sections D.4 — D.7; these permissions apply to Your Content. You understand you will receive no payment for this. If a pre-existing license already grants these permissions, no additional license is required. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

#### 4. License Grant to Us
&dagger; You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. 

<TABLE>
 <TR>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">You want at least one example of what these rights enable us to do with Your Content</TD>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">
     <details>
        <summary open="false">:collapsible:</summary><BR>

Such examples:
       
- Copy it to our database and make backups
- Show it to you and other users
- Parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers
- Share it with other users
- Perform it (in case Your Content is something like music or video)

    </details>
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>


This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.

#### 5. License Grant to Other Users
&dagger; Any User-Generated Content you post publicly (including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories) may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

&dagger; If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

#### 6. Contributions Under Repository License
&dagger; Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound".

#### 7. Moral Rights
&dagger; You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

&dagger; You grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

<BR>

## E. Private Repositories
<details><summary open="false"><b>:short:</b> </summary>

**Short version:** *You may have access to private repositories. We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.*

</details>

#### 1. Control of Private Repositories
Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

#### 2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories
GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

#### 3. Access
<TABLE>
 <TR>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">You want to know one/some/all situation(s) in which GitHub employees may access the content of your private repositories</TD>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">
    <details>
      <summary open="false">:collapsible:</summary><BR>
      
All such situations:

- With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If GitHub accesses a private repository for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge
- When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub's systems and Service

#### 2. Confidentiality 

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

&dagger; **Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

&dagger; **Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that: (a) becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) is known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) is independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) is disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a legal requirement from legal authorities, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law. 

#### 3. Feedback

&dagger; If you choose to give us any feedback for our products or services (“Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.
