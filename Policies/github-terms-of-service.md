# The GitHub Terms of Service
&dagger; Effective date: November 13, 2019

<BR>
<TABLE BORDER="1px"><TR><TD>

## Important Preliminaries

#### One-row, two-cell tables
&dagger; For each one-row, two-cell table in this document, whilst the condition detailed in the left cell of the table evaluates to true, the right cell of the table should be observed. In such cases, the right cell should be read straight after the left cell, to provide the correct context for the right-cell text. In all other cases, the right cell can be ignored. Such tables are meant to be read in this manner, and have no other significance.

#### About collapsible texts
<TABLE>
 <TR>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">&dagger;&nbsp;You&nbsp;lack&nbsp;information on&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;use collapsible&nbsp;texts</TD>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">

&dagger; The heading for any particular&nbsp;block of collapsible&nbsp;text is always&nbsp;displayed, whether&nbsp;the&nbsp;block be&nbsp;collapsed or expanded. You&nbsp;can&nbsp;toggle whether&nbsp;a&nbsp;block of collapsible&nbsp;text is&nbsp;expanded or collapsed, by&nbsp;clicking&nbsp;upon the block's&nbsp;heading.
   </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

#### ‘:collapsible:’ texts
&dagger; The text ':collapsible:' is only and always used as the heading for a block of collapsible text where the block isn't one of the summaries outlined in the “Section titles and summaries” subsection <sup>*(that comes just after this subsection)*</sup>. The text within such blocks **are** legally binding to the extent that they are relevant. 

#### Section titles and summaries
&dagger; The different sections in this document have titles. They sometimes also have brief summaries, where each such summary is composed of a block of collapsible text having the text ':short:' as its heading.

<TABLE>
 <TR>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">&dagger; You want extra, inessential information about these summaries</TD>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">
     <details><summary open="false">:collapsible:</summary><BR>

&dagger; Each such summary appears just after the relevant section title, and immediately before the relevant section body. The collapsible block for such a summary is expanded when the text on the first line beneath the relevant ':short:' text, begins with the text 'Short version:'.
    </details>
   </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

&dagger; Such titles and summaries are not legally binding, and so can be completely ignored.

#### Daggered texts
&dagger; In order to understand the obligations contractually articulated for you in this document, you only need to read the texts marked with a dagger &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>(*single-character symbol at beginning of this paragraph*).</sup>

<TABLE>
 <TR>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">&dagger; Such&nbsp;dagger&nbsp;use, which&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;fact the&nbsp;only use&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;dagger, is&nbsp;important in your processing/reading&nbsp;of&nbsp;this&nbsp;document</TD>
   <TD VALIGN="TOP">
     <details><summary open="false">:collapsible:</summary><BR>

<p>&dagger; Texts are marked with daggers:</p><p>

* when a paragraph &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>(*which might be just one sentence*)</sup><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begins with a dagger,</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<sub>AS&nbsp;WELL&nbsp;AS</sub>*&nbsp;<p>
* when a list forms the first text immediately after either:</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ◦ such a daggered paragraph &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<sub>OR</sub>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ a dagger by itself.
</p><BR>
&dagger;&nbsp;Please&nbsp;note&nbsp;that if&nbsp;the&nbsp;dagger&nbsp;symbol is&nbsp;not being&nbsp;rendered for&nbsp;you, this&nbsp;subsection may&nbsp;not be&nbsp;helpful for&nbsp;discovering all&nbsp;such&nbsp;obligations. Also&nbsp;note&nbsp;that whilst&nbsp;the&nbsp;text&nbsp;':collapsible:' never&nbsp;begins with&nbsp;a&nbsp;dagger, in&nbsp;the&nbsp;absence of&nbsp;an&nbsp;indication that&nbsp;you&nbsp;don't need&nbsp;to&nbsp;examine a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;collapsible&nbsp;text, you&nbsp;do need&nbsp;to&nbsp;expand such&nbsp;collapsible&nbsp;text to&nbsp;check whether&nbsp;there&nbsp;are any&nbsp;texts relevant&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;rule outlined&nbsp;here within&nbsp;such&nbsp;collapsible&nbsp;blocks.

- A&nbsp;valid&nbsp;email&nbsp;address is&nbsp;required to&nbsp;complete the&nbsp;signup&nbsp;process<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>(*which&nbsp;is explicitly&nbsp;specified in&nbsp;document*).</sup>
  
<BR>&dagger;&nbsp;Example&nbsp;of possible&nbsp;obligation that&nbsp;is not&nbsp;contractually articulated&nbsp;for&nbsp;you in&nbsp;this&nbsp;document, and&nbsp;hence where&nbsp;dagger has&nbsp;**not** been&nbsp;used:
- You&nbsp;believe you&nbsp;are obligated&nbsp;to backup some&nbsp;of&nbsp;your&nbsp;GitHub&nbsp;content because&nbsp;of GitHub’s&nbsp;liability&nbsp;limitation in&nbsp;the&nbsp;document.<BR>The&nbsp;document doesn’t&nbsp;articulate that&nbsp;you need&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, but&nbsp;you have&nbsp;inferred that&nbsp;such an&nbsp;obligation exists<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>(*in&nbsp;an indirect&nbsp;way*).</sup>
